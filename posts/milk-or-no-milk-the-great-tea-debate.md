When it comes to tea, if there's one topic guaranteed to get people talking and raise some eyebrows, it's the question of whether to add milk. Without further ado, let's dive into this age-old conundrum and try to detangle the many factors influencing the choice to go milky or not. Be prepared to steer your way through this udderly fascinating discussion, and feel free to chime in below with your own personal opinions on this matter!

### A Little History
To begin with, let's establish that adding milk to tea wasn't always a thing. In fact, the concept of mixing milk and tea goes back to the early 18th century, when tea first made its way to Europe from China. At that time, European porcelain tea cups were known to crack under boiling hot liquid, so milk was added to cool the tea before consuming. Thus, tea and milk became inseparable for many tea enthusiasts, and the debate began.

However, it's important to remember that tea culture varies across the globe, and there are several different tea-drinking traditions with their own way of doing things. While some cultures will never dream of adding milk to their tea, others consider it an essential part of their tea experience.

| Japan         | No milk in tea                                         |
| Morocco       | No milk in green tea with mint                         |
| Turkey        | No milk in tea, served with sugar cubes                |
| Russia        | No milk in tea, often brewed strong and enjoyed with jam |

### Milk: Do's and Don'ts
When it comes to pairing milk with different types of tea, there are some general guidelines.

#### Do's
1. Black tea: Especially strong black teas like Assam, Darjeeling, and English Breakfast, which can hold their own against milk's creaminess.
2. Chai: Traditional Indian masala chai is made using black tea, spices, and milk, resulting in a rich, comforting beverage.
3. Earl Grey: This flavored black tea boasts the citrusy bergamot flavor, which can work well with milk for some – though this has its own fierce supporter base.
4. London Fog: A variant of Earl Grey with added steamed milk and vanilla syrup.

#### Don'ts
1. Green tea: Green tea's delicate, grassy flavors clash with milk's heaviness.
2. White tea: Soft, subtly sweet white tea deserves to be enjoyed unadulterated.
3. Oolong tea: The nuances of oolong tea can be lost when combined with milk.
4. Herbal tea: Similarly, milk can overwhelm the distinct flavors found in herbal infusions, though preferences may differ for herbal blends like camomile and rooibos.

### The Health Angle
Many tea drinkers prefer to enjoy tea without milk for its potential health benefits. It's no secret that tea is packed with antioxidants and other nutrients that are good for our health. However, the addition of milk may affect the way these nutrients are absorbed.

Studies have shown that milk can bind to tea-based antioxidants called catechins, making them less effective in our bodies. Similarly, it may potentially inhibit the absorption of particular nutrients by our systems.

On the flip side, tea with milk can be more soothing for those with sensitivities to tannins – compounds that are found in tea leaves that can lead to astringency and the possibility of stomach issues for some drinkers.

### Personal Preference and Cultural Identity
Ultimately, the choice to consume tea with or without milk boils down to a matter of personal preference and cultural identity. For some, the very idea of milk in tea is akin to sacrilege, while others can't fathom enjoying their cuppa any other way.

At the end of the day, whether you're a purist who believes tea's delicate flavors should be enjoyed without any interference, or a staunch advocate of the perfect creaminess only milk can provide, our shared love of tea unites us all.
